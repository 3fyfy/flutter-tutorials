# Final phase

In this folder you can find the final code for the tutorial. It contains a home_final_singlefile.dart which is all the code for the UI in one file for devs that just wants to see the code.

I am still busy working on this and will be done when the second tutorial is posted on medium. See the first one here to get to this point.
